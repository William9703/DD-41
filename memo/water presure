PVC/PPR pump could handle up to 2.0MPa (20 bar, 200m), which is OK for the project. The PVC piples could be used as the ROV body.

All external devices needs to be IPx9 standard. Or, submersible with 50m (better 100m) deep water.
Note: wire connector need to be sealable and satisfied with IPx9 standard. Otherwise, current may flow through lake water between pins.
