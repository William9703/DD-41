Write some ideas here.

The file name should be xxx.md. The md file extension will make the file a markdown text file.

For example:

- Some idea.
- Some very good idea.

However, it is OK to use txt file. Txt file is easy to use, but it may not be clear as a md file.

You can modify the memo later, and everything will be tracked (when you check the history of this file).

For example, If you go to the "history" or "blame", you can see what I have modify on this file.

By doing this, we will not forget good ideas, and we can use this function as our log book.
