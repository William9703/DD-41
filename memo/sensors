Sensor list:

Presure sensor
  0bar - 10bar, may dive deeper than design
    Reference table
    050m deep = 05atm = 05bar = 075psi = 0500kPa = 05000hPa (05k)
    100m deep = 10atm = 10bar = 150psi = 1000kPa = 10000hPa (10k)

Speed sensor ???(Hard to mesure water speed, especially at low speed)
  Flow gauge * 3 (3-axis)
 
Voltage sensor
  Monitor battery voltage (Using voltage divider + ADC)

Gyro + Accelerometer + Temp + Mag(compass)
  MPU-9250
  GPS not required (in water, hard to get GPS signal)

Water/Wetness sensor
  Protect water leakage of the ROV body
  If water leak, send alert
