# ROV tech document - Mechanical structure


## Introduction

A summary of the mechanical structure


## Design

### Design parameters

What is the purpose of this? What spec we need to satisfy?

In order to satisfy these requirement, what we need? (Summary)

### Part 1 (Something we need to satisfy the requirement)

What is this part? What is it for? what is its porperty? In detail

Anything we need topay attention when useing this part? If no, delete this line.

### Part 2

(Simular to part 1)


## Implementation

### Headhub

What we have in head hub? How we assembly them?

### Body

What we have on the body? How we assembly them?

### Tail hub

What we have? How we assembly them?

### Trim

Why we need balance the buoyancy and gravity? What we do to satisfy this?

Whay we need to locate the center of weigth and the center of buoyancy? What we do to satisfy this?

Anything else we do?


## Experiment

What we do in the bathtub? Result?

What we do in the water tank? Result? What omprovement we may need?
