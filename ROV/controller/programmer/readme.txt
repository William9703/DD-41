This program is used to program the fuse of the ATmega328P (manually).

Have an Arduino and the ATmega328P with bootloader. Don't have dedicated ISP, and don't want to spend time and money to buy an ISP.
Arduino bootloader is OK when writing flash; however, it cannot write the fuse. So, write a simple programer that deal with the fuse.
